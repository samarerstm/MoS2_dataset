Data Organization

The .yaml files are categorized into different folders based on their energy relative to the convex hull. For example, the folder dE_0.2_0.3 contains structures with energies between 0.2 and 0.3 eV/atom above the global minimum.

Units

All data are provided in atomic units:

Energy: Hartree (Ha)

Length: Bohr

Force: Ha/Bohr

Computational Details

The dataset was generated using the PW91 exchange-correlation functional in combination with Vanderbilt ultra-soft pseudopotentials.

Data Usage

You are not required to use all the available data. Structures with energy differences greater than 0.5 eV/atom above the global minimum can be ignored.
